    Our robots like a game that require ability to calculate.  In the latest journey they found a new game -- Numbered Triangles.
    In this game a player take 6 chips from the pile. Each chip is a equilateral triangle with three numbers on the edges.

    You can move, rotate and flip the chips so they form a hexagon.
    The hexagon is <strong>only legal</strong> if edges common to two triangles have the same number on them.
    <!--You may not flip any triangle over.-->
</p>

<p>
    The score for a legal hexagon is the sum of the numbers on the outside six edges.
    The player's goal to find the highest score that can be achieved with the given six chips.
